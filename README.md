# JNI-Application
1st application
 Create a JNI program that displays Classification of Honours based on the input of the user. Before CGPA is keyed in, the main program will ask user to choose whether Degree or Diploma Programme.  If user chooses Diploma Programme, first native method will be invoked. If user selects Degree Programme, second native method will be invoked. 
2nd application
 Create a JNI program based on the condition below: • Java file requests user to enter one number to determine the size of an array. • The number is passed into first native method. • In the first native method:  • Create an array with random number within the range of 1 to 100.  • If there is number less than 50, display the number.  • If no number less than 50, then display a “not found” message. 
 
• In the second native method: • Input the generated array from the first native method. • Based on the array, calculate the difference of min and max number of the array. • Pass the difference of min and max number back to the Java file. • Java file then display the difference of min and max number in the main program.
